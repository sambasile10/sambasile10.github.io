									<h2>About Me</h2>
								</header>
								<p>
									Hello to whoever has ventured into my website. My name is Sam Basile and I’m currently a senior at the University of Colorado Boulder majoring in Computer Science. I’m very interested in cybersecurity, particularly regarding cloud infrastructure. I like to learn about security flaws, fixes, and postmortems (such as this neat <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEsshExn7aE">example</a>) of Operating Systems. Ever since I started programming by making Minecraft mods as a teenager I’ve been learning by making my projects and tinkering with computers. I like to watch Twitch and have made some projects based around the platform which are showcased in this portfolio. I’m also a big fan of the Raspberry Pi which has served as my opportunity to dip my toes into the colossal ocean that is Linux. I also enjoy tabletop games. I've been having a blast with DnD 5e for a while now (in case someone is wondering: Inquisitive Rogue). I’m currently employed as a Software Engineer in Test on the Common Web Services team at SketchUp.
									<br />This portfolio is to serve as a repository to work I’ve done and things that I find interesting. There are expositions of the projects I’ve done in this portfolio, links to all of my social media – my LinkedIn and my Twitter where I retweet all things Computer Science related that I find interesting. I hope that someone else can find some new YouTubers or researchers that they like from here. My resume is included here as well.

								<h5>Home Lab</h5>
								<p>I like to fiddle around with building small homelab projects, I currently have a Raspberry Pi that I use as a NAS. I’m repurposing my old computer to be a server for a few Docker containers - the most important use being a Minecraft server. Playing around with a Raspberry Pi served as my introduction to a lot of Linux topics and I still get to learn from it today.</p>
								<h5>DnD</h5>
								<p>Last year I joined the CU DnD Club and over the past year I’ve gotten into Dungeons and Dragons. It’s been super fun, I like that, in contrast to video games, it’s a tabletop game where you get to physically be with people. It takes teamwork and creativity to succeed and is just an all around good time.</p>
								<h5>Twitch</h5>
								<p>I like Twitch and I find that ecosystem on it to be very interesting as the entire website is one giant web of interconnected communities. I've done a lot of work in the past with their API which can be found in the projects section. </p>

								<h5>Twitch Tracker</h5>
								<p>
									Twitch Tracker was a project I made that recorded which streams are being watched by which users for a month straight. My data scraper was made in Typescript and used PostgreSQL for storage. After a month of data collection, community detection and clustering algorithms were used to create a ‘map’ of the website, where streams that had high overlaps in viewership are clustered together.

								<h5>Twitch Logger</h5>
								<p>
									Twitch Logger was a project that records and stores messages sent on predefined Twitch chat channels and allows for them to be searched later on. It consists of a Typescript backend for recording and storage using MongoDB as well as a web-based frontend written in React for searching through messages.

								<h5>PlaylistPal</h5>
								<p>
									PlaylistPal is a work-in-progress project that allows for the transferring of music playlists between different streaming platforms (YouTube, Apple Music, and Spotify). Users can easily select a source platform and a playlist on it alongside a destination platform and PlaylistPal will do its best to transfer the playlist. It gives users the option to do manual corrections of songs it may have missed. It has a Java Spring backend and a web-based frontend written with Svelte.
